About Me

Hello, I'm Zain! I'm passionate about using technology to make sense of complex systems and improve productivity. I focus on leveraging machine learning and AI to create more efficient workflows, minimizing the repetitive burdens of day-to-day life. Inspired by concepts like "Cortana" from Halo, I envision creating my own "second brain" that helps me—and others—stay organized, especially on the tough days when focus doesn't come naturally.

My work is about helping individuals and organizations make better data-driven decisions, automate their workflows, and extract insights to act intelligently and confidently.
